# Blended APP

This is a demo app that shows how we can interact from solidity with rust contracts using Fluent.

For more details you can check the [Building a Blended App](https://docs.fluentlabs.xyz/learn/developer-guides/building-a-blended-app) tutorial.

# Fluent Blended Escrow & Reputation App

This project is a **Blended App** built with [Fluent](https://fluent.xyz), combining smart contracts and off-chain logic.  
It demonstrates how to integrate **escrow contracts** with a **reputation system**, allowing secure transactions and trust building between participants.
